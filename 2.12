The variables are stored at their allocated memory addresses 0x7fffffffde48 and 0x7fffffffde4c. The address-of operator (&) along with the print command can be used to print the address of a variable. The x command can be used to display the values in their stored data type. The command shows that the integer 19088743 is stored at its respective momory address and the float value 19088.7422 is stored at its respective momory address. Both the values can be displayed in hexadecmal using the correct format letter and when the bytes stored in memory are displayed seperately, they appear to follow the little endian storage order. The least significant byte is stored in the lowest-numbered address and the smallest byte comes first in memory.
