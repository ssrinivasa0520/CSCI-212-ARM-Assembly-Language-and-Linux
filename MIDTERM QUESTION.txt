Write an ARM assembler program (DO NOT WRITE THE CODE IN C THEN AUTOGENERATE TO ASSEMBLER) to play the game High-Low.  
Your program will randomly generate a number between 1 to 20 (i.e., includes 1 and include 20).  It will then ask the user to guess that number.  
If it the user enters a number too low, print a message that it is too low, if the number is too high, print a message that it is too high, otherwise tell the user that he/she guessed it correctly.  
Allow the user only 3 chances to guess, and if the user fails to guess correctly after 3 tries, print out YOU LOSE.

Your code should have at a minimum THREE functions: main.s, generate_number.s, get_user_guess.s.

main.s will drive the functions call

generate_number.s will generate the random number from 1 to 20

get)user_guess.s will get a guess from the user

Example:

(program generates a random number, say 5)

Please enter a guess:  10

Too high, guess again

Please enter a guess: 1

Too low, guess again

Please enter a guess: 6

You lost!

Please provide a makefile to compile your code into an executable called "hilow".  

ZIP up the entire directory and submit it.
